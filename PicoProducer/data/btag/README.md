## B-tag data

Instructions to use create the root files with `getBTagEfficiencies.py`,
and to use them with `BTagWeightTool` in [`python/corrections/BTagTool.py`](../../python/corrections/BTagTool.py)
are available in the [parent directory](..#b-tagging-tools).

Examples of efficiency maps per jet flavor, and as a function of jet pT versus jet eta for the mutau analysis in 2017 are shown [here](https://ineuteli.web.cern.ch/ineuteli/btag/2017/?match=mutau).
